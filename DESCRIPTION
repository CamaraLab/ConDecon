Description: ConDecon is a clustering-independent deconvolution method for 
            estimating cell abundances in bulk tissues using single-cell RNA-seq 
            data. The aim of ConDecon is to infer a probability distribution across 
            a reference single-cell RNA-seq data that represents the likelihood 
            for each cell in the reference data to be present in the query bulk 
            tissue.
